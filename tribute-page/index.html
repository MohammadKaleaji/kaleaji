        <h3 id="tribute-info">Here is below a list of facts about dragons: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The name dragon is derived from the Latin word 'draconem' which means 'huge serpent'.</li>
            <li>Western, or European, dragons tend to be very large fire-breathing, serpent-like, scaly creatures with wings.</li>
            <li>Eastern, or Chinese, dragons tend to be smaller creatures, with no wings, horns for ears, and are friends of humans.</li>
            <li>Dragons in literature often have red eyes, and depending on the culture, they possess different powers.</li>
            <li>In Chinese culture there are three dragon species including the lung (sky), kiau (marsh), and li (sea). In Chinese culture dragons are often used as symbols of imperial power.</li>
            <li>In Ancient Greece there were four dragon species including the serpent Dracones, Cetea the sea creature, Dracaenae a female dragon, and Chimera the fire-breathing dragon.</li>
            <li>Icelanders turned Viking ships away whenever they approached with dragons on their ships. Iceland's coat of arms has a dragon depicted on it.</li>
            <li>The Ancient Japanese believed that dragons were looked like serpents and were water gods.</li>
            <li>In many legends and mythology, dragons breathe fire, but they have also been known to breathe ice.</li>
            <li>There are some real dragons in existence including the Komodo dragon, and the thorny devil lizard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-fact">
            Ice dragons are said to roam the Shivering Sea and the White Waste. Reportedly, they are far larger than the dragons of Valyria and are made of living ice, with eyes of pale blue crystal, vast translucent wings, and breath of cold.
