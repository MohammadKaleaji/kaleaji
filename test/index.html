                    Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited
                    since the
                    sixth millennium BC.[10] Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari, just south of the old city
                    of
                    Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium
                    BC.[11] That
                    is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and
                    Mesopotamia,
                    which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and military
                    importance.[12] Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center
                    between the
                    Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia.
